## Neural Networks 
This project utilizes pre-trained neural network models for expression, age, and gender classification functionalities. All of this information can be found in the dataset folder. The sources for these models and their data is also included below:
1. The 'Kaggle Facial Expression Recognition Challenge' Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data
    - Consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale face images
    - Each image corresponds to 1 of 7 expression categories
    - Total dataset contains approximately 36,000 images

2. Age and Gender Detection Deep Learning Model
    - Created and trained by Gil Levi and Tal Hassner using the Adience datset https://talhassner.github.io/home/projects/Adience/Adience-data.html
    - The trained model files can be downloaded from https://talhassner.github.io/home/publication/2015_CVPR
